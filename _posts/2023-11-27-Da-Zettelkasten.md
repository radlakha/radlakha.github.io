I am starting a \#zettelkasten method for my notes using Obsidian note
software. I intend to use it to capture my notes on everything I read,
hear, watch and experience during travels and in life.

For a very long time I have been wondering what to do with all the
insights, ideas and learning I gather from all that I read, hear and
watch - especially reading. I would use various methods to capture
things I felt are nice but they will be all over the place - underlines
and highlights, in margins, slips of paper, post-it notes, journals and
notebooks, Evernote and Notion. But I had never figured out a way how to
mine these notes of mine, until, I started reading the book Ahrens, S.
(2017). *How to take smart notes: One simple technique to boost writing,
learning and thinking: for students, academics and nonfiction book
writers*. Ahrens, S., 2017. How to take smart notes: one simple
technique to boost writing, learning and thinking: for students,
academics and nonfiction book writers. CreateSpace, North Charleston,
SC.

I started reading the book ‘How to take smart notes’ (Ahrens 2017) And,
taking help from article from article on Scribber (Caulfield 2020) to
understand how citation, references and bibliography are used.

Now do you see me?(Phelan 2023)

This book is explanation of Zettelkasten method. It was not my first
inquiry into Zettelkasten but it was the first time I got it. They say
there is time for everything. I guess time for my Zettelkasten slip-box
cam during my Travel to [Bombay in August
